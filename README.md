An application for developing materials for the hpc-unplugged lesson for computational thinking. The lesson that accompanies this tool can be found at https://www.nicole-brewer.com/hpc-unplugged/.

The goal of this application is to produce a color-by-number grid and answer key. The output file is a standard 8.5 x 11 PDF which can be printed for in-class use.

## Status and Future Work

This Jupyter Notebook currently only produces grids with randomized numbers. It is possible to change the numbers of cell in a grid, but the formatting needs to be improved. In the future, I'd like to turn this notebook into a web application. I'd like teachers to be able to upload their own pictures, which are granularized into pixel art. This way, students can incorperate narratives or themes that match student interests.
